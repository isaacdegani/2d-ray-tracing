# RayTracing
Module for tracing light rays through simple (2D, Linear) optical systems.

An optical system is built up of "sources," "elements," and an "image."
Many different sources and elements are available and can be customized
and placed with user parameters.

The system is simulated as rays propagating through a matplotlib plot.
Rays originate from sources, interact with elements, and terminate
at an image. Intensity graphs of the source beams and image are generated.

See EXAMPLE.py for usage
